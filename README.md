My name is Alfred Bazin, and this repository is a summary of the project I have worked including personal projects as well as projects completed during my training courses at EDX, OpenClassrooms. It shows different aspects of machine learning and python programming I have explored. It demonstrates the workflow I have developed for importing, cleaning and visualising data taking advantage of a wide variety of libraries. The project includes a variety of models for supervised and unsupervised machine learning for regression or classification tasks.
