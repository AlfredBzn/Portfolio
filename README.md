This portfolio is a summary of the project I have worked on during my training courses at EDX, OpenClassrooms as well as personal projects I have created for personal development. It shows all the different aspects of machine learning and python programming I have explored. It also demonstrates my capacity to use a wide variety of libraries for importing data, cleaning data, data visualization and machine learning.
