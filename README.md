# Welcome to my portfolio

My name is **Alfred Bazin**, and this repository is a summary of the project I have worked on including personal projects as well as projects completed during my training courses. It shows different aspects of machine learning and python programming I have explored. It demonstrates the workflow I have developed for **importing**, **cleaning** and **visualising data** taking advantage of a wide variety of **libraries**. The project includes models for **supervised** and **unsupervised machine learning** for **regression** as well as **classification** tasks.

If you want more information about my **training** and **experiences** or if you want to **contact me**, here is the link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-bazin/)

## Summary of the projects:

-	[Estimation of polymer Tg through machine learning](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/Prediction_of_polymers_Tg)

- Kaggle project : RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection **(to be added soon)**

- Application of GANs and VAEs to chemistry. **(to be added soon)**

**OpenClassroom projects**

*All OpenClassroom projects are based on real problematics and dataset either available on open-data platforms or in Kaggle projects.*
-	[Project on computer vision: Classification of dog breeds with convolutional networks and transfer learning](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/OpenClassrooms/Computer_vision)
-	[Project on supervised ML algorithms: Prediction of energy use and greenhouse gases emission for buildings](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/OpenClassrooms/Supervised_ML)
-	[Project on unsupervised ML algorithms: Clustering of customers from an online marketplace](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/OpenClassrooms/Non_supervised_ML)

**EDX IBM projects**

*The work produced in the final project is presented. The project is based on the data of SpaceX obtained through web scrapping technics.*
-	[EDX/IBM Capstone project](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/EDX_IBM)
