# Welcome to my portfolio

My name is **Alfred Bazin**, and this repository is a summary of the project I have worked including personal projects as well as projects completed during my training courses. It shows different aspects of machine learning and python programming I have explored. It demonstrates the workflow I have developed for **importing**, **cleaning** and **visualising data** taking advantage of a wide variety of **libraries**. The project includes models for **supervised** and **unsupervised machine learning** for **regression** as well as **classification** tasks.

## Summary of the projects:

-	[Estimation of polymer Tg through machine learning](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/Prediction_of_polymers_Tg)

**OpenClassroom projects**

*All OpenClassroom projects are based on real problematics and dataset either available on open-data platforms or in Kaggle projects.*
-	[Project on computer vision: Classification of dog breeds with convolutional networks and transfer learning](https://github.com/Owlmium/Portfolio/tree/main/OpenClassrooms/Computer_vision)
-	[Project on supervised ML algorithms: Prediction of energy use and greenhouse gases emission for buildings]()
-	[Project on unsupervised ML algorithms: Clustering of customers from an online marketplace]()

**EDX IBM project**

*The work produced in the final project is presented. The project is based on the data of SpaceX obtained through web scrapping technics.*
-	[EDX/IBM Capstone project]()
